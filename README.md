# SalesAnalysis
A simple data analysis project that mimics real world business type sales questions. 
Project that helps to understand and familiarise with pandas, data preprocessing and visualisation using matplotlib.

Sales questions that I have tried to answer in this project-

1) What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2) Which US city had the highest number of sales?
3) What time should we display advertisements to maximise likelihood of customer's buying product?
4) What products are often sold together?
5) What product sold the most and why do think it sold the most?
